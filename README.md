# Water

## Motivation

I want easily customizable file and directory scaffolds. Which I recently read was super hard. Anyway.

## Usage

```shell
# First, create the file or folder you wish to grow into something spectacular
touch <filename>
# or
mkdir <directory name>

# For example
touch Makefile

# Then, water it with nurishing liquid to sproud it into a beautiful growth
water Makefile
```

## Installation

See [instructions](INSTALL.md)

## Configuration

See [full example config](examples/water.yaml)

## Creating templates

See [example templates directory](examples/templates)
